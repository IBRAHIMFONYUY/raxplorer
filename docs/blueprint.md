- API Request Tool: Craft and execute API requests with customizable headers and parameters. It includes common methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and displays responses in JSON and other text-based formats.
- Auto-Documentation: AI automatically generates API documentation from endpoint definitions, enhancing readability and developer onboarding. This documentation is live and stays in sync when an endpoint definition changes.
- Code Snippet Generation: Generate code snippets for API requests in various languages such as Node.js, Python, and Go. LLM uses a tool to generate examples from endpoint definitions and automatically selects appropriate examples based on the developer's preferred language.
- Visual API Flow Builder: Drag-and-drop interface to simulate API workflows and sequences. Enables chaining of requests and setting dependencies to visualize data flow between API endpoints.
- Interactive Challenges: Gamified API learning mode with interactive challenges, awarding XP for completing tasks and mastering API concepts.
- Mock Server Generator: AI generates mock APIs from OpenAPI specifications or natural language descriptions to simulate API behavior for testing purposes. LLM is used as a tool for building the fake server definitions.
